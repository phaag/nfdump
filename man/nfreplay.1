.Nd replay binary flow files as netflow version v5 or v9 to a remote host
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm 
.Fl r Ar flowfile
.Fl H Ar remotehost
.Fl p Ar port
.Op Fl S Ar sourceaddress
.Op Fl j Ar mcastgroup
.Op Fl 4
.Op Fl 6

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads binary flow files stored by any nfdump collector and sents the flow records
to a remote host or a multicat group. 
.Pp
.Nm
sends the data as netflow v5 or v9 to the remote location.
.Pp
.Nm
accepts a filter to limit the flows to be sent. The filter syntax is equivalent to
nfdump. 
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl r Ar flowfile
Read input data from
.Ar flowfile.
.It Fl H Ar remotehost
Send all flows to this remote host. Accepts a symbolic name or a IPv4/IPv6 
IP address.
.It Fl j Ar mcastgroup
Join this multicast group and send all flows to this group host. Accepts a 
symbolic name or multicast IPv4/IPv6 IP address.
.It Fl p Ar port
Send all flows to this port on the remote side. Default is 9995.
.It Fl S Ar sourceaddress
Source address used when sending Netflow data. Default is automatic address selection.
.It Fl 4
Forces
.Nm
to send flows to a IPv4 address only. Can be used if the remote host has
an IPv4 and IPv6 address record.
.It Fl 6
Forces
.Nm
to send flows to a IPv6 address only. Can be used if the remote host has
an IPv4 and IPv6 address record.
.It Fl v Ar version
Send flows as netflow version
.Ar version . 
Version V5 and v9 are supported. In v5 mode, all additional elements to a 
stadard v5 record are skipped and 64bit counters are truncated to 32bit. 
The default is v9. 
.It Fl u Ar usec
Delay each record by
.Ar usec
mirco seconds, to avoid overrun on the remote host. Default is 10usec.
.It Fl B Ar buffsize
Set send buffer to
.Ar buffsize
size in bytes. Useful to buffer larger data transfers.
.It Fl z Ar num
Flows are sent with their "real distribution" acrross time (with a speed coefficient)
.Bl -item -compact
.It
.Fl z
1 : 5 minutes of records will be sent in 5 minutes.
.IT
.Fl
z
20 : 5 minutes of record will be sent in 5/20 = 0.25 minutes.
.El
.It Fl c Ar num
Limit number of records to send to the first 
.Ar num
flows.
.It Fl V
Print
.Nm 
version and exit.
.It Fl h
Print help text on stdout with all options and exit.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Bl -item -compact
.Nm
returns
.It
255 Initialization failed.
.It
254 Error in filter syntax.
.It
250 Internal error.
