2009-11-0801 snapshot-1.6b-20090806
- Add srcmask and dstmask aggregation
- Add csv output mode. -o csv
- Fix some bugs of previous beta
- Add bidirectional aggregation of flows ( -b, -B )
- Add possibility to save aggregated flows into file ( -w )
  Note: This results in a behaviour change for -w in combination
  with aggragation )
- Extend -N ( do not scale numbers ) to all text output not just summary
- Make extension handling more robust for some moody IOSes.
- Remove header lines of -s stat, when using -q ( quiet ) 
  Note: This results in a behaviour change for -N

2009-06-19 snapshot-1.6b-20090717
- Flow-tools converter updated - supports more common elements.
- Sflow collector updated. Supports more common elements.
- Add sampling to nfdump. Sampling is automatically recognised
  in v5 undocumented header fields and in v9 option templates.
  see nfcapd.1(1)
- Add @include option for filter to include more filter files.
- Add flexible aggregation comparable to Flexible Netflow (FNF)
- All new tags can be selected in -o fmt:... see nfdump(1)
- topN stat for all new tags is implemented
- Integrate developer code to read from pcap files into stable
- Update filter syntax for new tags
- Added more v9 tags for netflow v9.
  The detailed tags are listed in nfcapd(1)
  Adding new tags also extended the binary file format with
  data block format 2, which is extension based. File format 
  for version <= 1.5.* ( Data block format 1 ) is read 
  transparently. Data block 2 are skipped by nfdump 1.5.7.
  32bit but AS and interface numbers are supported.
- Add flexible storage option for nfcapd. To save disk space, the 
  data extensions to be stored in the data file are user selectable.
- Added option for multiple netflow stream to same port.
  -n <Ident,IP,base_directory>
  Example: -n router1,192.168.100.1,/var/nfdump/router1
  So multiple -n options may be given at the command line
  Old style syntax still works for compatibility, ( -I .. -l ... )
  but then only one source is supported.
- Move to automake for building nfdump
- Switch scaling factor ( k, M, G ) from 1024 to 1000.
- Make nfdump fully 64bit compliant. ( 8bit data alignments and access )

			example: traffic of a whole subnet -A srcip4/24 -s srcip/bytes

nfdump		Add more stat element option. -s <stat> now supports:
			srcip, dstip, ip, srcport, dstport, port, srcas, dstas, as, inif, outif, proto

nfdump		Add -z. Suppress writing flows to data files. Only stat information is written.
nfprofile	Used only be nfsen for upcoming shadow profiles. If you don't understand this
			simply ignore it.

nfdump		Add -q option to suppress header as well as stat information at the bottom
nfprofile	for easier post processing with external programms.

nf_common.c	Output format processsing rewritting for more flexibility. Besides standard
nfdump.c	output formats line, long extended etc., user defined output formats are now 
			possible and can even be compiled into nfdump for easy access. See -o fmt:<format>
			and nfdump.c around line 100.

*.*			Integrate netflow v9 into nfdump. Only a subset of v9 is stored into
			the data files, basically everything needed for nfdump to work as it did before.
			This also includes IPv6 support for any nfdump options. CryptoPAN extended
			to work with IPv6. IPv6 condensed output format for better readability.
			Output formats available in long and condensed mode: e.g. line -> line6
			extended -> extended6

*.*			Replace binary data file format. Old format not flexible enough for
			upcoming netflow v9/sflow data. *.stat files are gone. The same 
			information is now available under nfdump -I
			New format about 5% larger in size, but faster for reading and writing.
			speed gain eaten up by more complex processing - sigh ..
			compat14 mode enables transparent reading of old style format.
			nffile.[ch] now handles all data file stuff.

nfreplay	Multicast enabled:
			Add -j <join group>. Joins the specified multicast group ( v4 or v6 )
			sending flows to this group.

nfreplay	IPv6 enabled:
			Add option -4 and -6 to force a specific protocol, otherwise
			protocol is automatically selected according the hostname to send flows to.
			Add -K key, to send data anonymized, using CryptoPAn

nfcapd		Multicast enabled:
			Add -j <join group>. Joins the specified multicast group ( v4 or v6 )
			for listening.

nfcapd		IPv6 enabled:
			Add option -4 and -6 for IPv4 and IPv6. By default, listen on IPv4.
			Option -b <host/IP> to bind for a specific host/IP address automatically
			selects appropriate protocol.

nfnet.c		All functions to setup network sockets for listening/sending are 
			put into this file.

2005-08-22 v1.4
- nfreplay:  Bug fix sending flows.
- nfdump:    Add CryptoPAn code to anonymize IP addresses. New option -K
- nfdump:    Change time format in output to ISO 8601 compatible: e.g. 1981-04-05 14:30:30.100
- nfdump:    Add scaling factor k,m,g to number in filter syntax: e.g. bytes > 1m
- nfdump:    Create new output format extended with additional fields pps, bps and bpp
- nfdump:    Rename output format extended to raw
- nfdump:    More than one single flow element statistic ( -s ) is now possible
- nfdump:    Add user defined sort order in flow element statistic
- nfdump:    Flow element statistic can be ordered by more than one order in the same run
- nfdump:    Add pps, bps and bpp fields in flow element statistics
- nfdump:    Add more symbolic protocols ESP, AH, GRP and RVSP to filter syntax
- nfdump:    Add duration, pps, bps and bpp to filter syntax
- nfdump:    Make nfdump miliseconds aware. Older versions skipped msecs.
  Binary nfdump file format changed due to this.
  output formats changed, due to this.
- nfdump:    Add interface in/out if <num> syntax to filter
- nfcapd:    Add flow_sequence check. Reports missing flows now.
- nfcapd:    Report statistics to syslog LOG_INFO when data file is rotated.
- ft2nfdump: Add ft2nfdump to read netflow data from flow-tools

2005-04-21 v1.3
- Add option -A for more flexible aggregation.
- Correct spelling errors :(

2005-03-04 v1.2.1
Bug fix release
- nfcapd: launcher subprocess may hang on Linux 2.6.x kernels.
  Cleaned up interrupt handling. 
- nfcapd: fix include order of socket.h and types.h in order to
  compile cleanly under FreeBSD 4.x
- nfcapd: clean up syslog logging.
- nfdump: Multiple sources ( -M ) and sort flows ( -m ) with 
  -c <limit> did not list the correct flows.
- nfprofile: Profiling with multiple sources may produce incorrect
  profiles. 

2004-12-20 v1.2
- nfcapd handles transparent v5 and v7 flows. v7 gets converted into v5
- nfcapd can execute any command at the end of interval. New option -x
- nfdump Extended filter syntax for flags, to, bytes and packets
- Rearrange output formats in nfdump: new switch -o, remove switch -E
  output formats: 'line', 'long', 'extended' and 'pipe'
- More flexible statistic handling in nfdump: cleanup ugly -s -s -s
  syntax. Replaced by -s <stat> option. New statistics for Port and AS.

2004-09-20 v 1.1
First public Version.
