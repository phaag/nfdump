- Add srcmask and dstmask aggregation
- Add csv output mode. -o csv
- Fix some bugs of previous beta
- Add bidirectional aggregation of flows ( -b, -B )
- Add possibility to save aggregated flows into file ( -w )
  Note: This results in a behaviour change for -w in combination
  with aggragation )
- Extend -N ( do not scale numbers ) to all text output not just summary
- Make extension handling more robust for some moody IOSes.
- Remove header lines of -s stat, when using -q ( quiet ) 
  Note: This results in a behaviour change for -N

- Move log functions to util.c

2009-06-19 snapshot-1.6b-20090717
- Flow-tools converter updated - supports more common elements.
- Sflow collector updated. Supports more common elements.
- Add sampling to nfdump. Sampling is automatically recognised
  in v5 undocumented header fields and in v9 option templates.
  see nfcapd.1(1)
- Add @include option for filter to include more filter files.
- Add flexible aggregation comparable to Flexible Netflow (FNF)
- All new tags can be selected in -o fmt:... see nfdump(1)
- topN stat for all new tags is implemented
- Integrate developer code to read from pcap files into stable
- Update filter syntax for new tags
- Added more v9 tags for netflow v9.
  The detailed tags are listed in nfcapd(1)
  Adding new tags also extended the binary file format with
  data block format 2, which is extension based. File format 
  for version <= 1.5.* ( Data block format 1 ) is read 
  transparently. Data block 2 are skipped by nfdump 1.5.7.
  32bit but AS and interface numbers are supported.
- Add flexible storage option for nfcapd. To save disk space, the 
  data extensions to be stored in the data file are user selectable.
- Added option for multiple netflow stream to same port.
  -n <Ident,IP,base_directory>
  Example: -n router1,192.168.100.1,/var/nfdump/router1
  So multiple -n options may be given at the command line
  Old style syntax still works for compatibility, ( -I .. -l ... )
  but then only one source is supported.
- Move to automake for building nfdump
- Switch scaling factor ( k, M, G ) from 1024 to 1000.
- Make nfdump fully 64bit compliant. ( 8bit data alignments and access )

2006-04-xx	v.1.5.1
			Fix bug in nfdump.c: Writing anonymized flows to file did not work corretly
			stdin input format now compatible with file format, therefore
			'nfdump < file' works again as it did in nfdump 1.4.
			Fix bug in nfcapd.c: Error handling not correct when receiving a non
			recognized netflow packet. Resulted in an endless loop
2006-03-27	snapshot 1.5-20060327
			Make all element statistics -s transport layer protocol
			independant by default. Add :p to stat name ( e.g. srcip:p ) to
			enable transport layer dependant statistics on request.
2006-03-20	snapshot 1.5-20060320
            Fix bug in filter engine: 'not flags xyz' produces wrong results
			when more than a single flag is specified.
			Minor man page fixes.

2006-03-06	v1.5
			Fix bug nfcapd. Laucher signaled too early. File not yet properly
			closed.

			Add srcas, dstas, input and output interfaces in aggregated
			output. 
			Fix IPv6 bug in filter: accept 1234:: address.
			rename nfcapd.curent tmp file to nfcapd.curren.<pid>. Poorly
			configured nfcapd processes may mess up themselves otherwise.

			Fix netflow v5 dPkts <-> dOctets collector bug.
			Update pipe format to include more information
			Allow AS number 0 in filter syntax.

2005-12-20	v1.5-beta-1
*.*			A lot of internal changes, not mentioned here. :(

nfdump		Add subnet aggregation for option -A
			A new syntax e.g. srcip4/24, dstip6/64 is supported for subnet wise aggregation.
			example: traffic of a whole subnet -A srcip4/24 -s srcip/bytes

nfdump		Add more stat element option. -s <stat> now supports:
			srcip, dstip, ip, srcport, dstport, port, srcas, dstas, as, inif, outif, proto

nfdump		Add -z. Suppress writing flows to data files. Only stat information is written.
nfprofile	Used only be nfsen for upcoming shadow profiles. If you don't understand this
			simply ignore it.

nfdump		Add -q option to suppress header as well as stat information at the bottom
nfprofile	for easier post processing with external programms.

nf_common.c	Output format processsing rewritting for more flexibility. Besides standard
nfdump.c	output formats line, long extended etc., user defined output formats are now 
			possible and can even be compiled into nfdump for easy access. See -o fmt:<format>
			and nfdump.c around line 100.

*.*			Integrate netflow v9 into nfdump. Only a subset of v9 is stored into
			the data files, basically everything needed for nfdump to work as it did before.
			This also includes IPv6 support for any nfdump options. CryptoPAN extended
			to work with IPv6. IPv6 condensed output format for better readability.
			Output formats available in long and condensed mode: e.g. line -> line6
			extended -> extended6

*.*			Replace binary data file format. Old format not flexible enough for
			upcoming netflow v9/sflow data. *.stat files are gone. The same 
			information is now available under nfdump -I
			New format about 5% larger in size, but faster for reading and writing.
			speed gain eaten up by more complex processing - sigh ..
			compat14 mode enables transparent reading of old style format.
			nffile.[ch] now handles all data file stuff.

nfreplay	Multicast enabled:
			Add -j <join group>. Joins the specified multicast group ( v4 or v6 )
			sending flows to this group.

nfreplay	IPv6 enabled:
			Add option -4 and -6 to force a specific protocol, otherwise
			protocol is automatically selected according the hostname to send flows to.
			Add -K key, to send data anonymized, using CryptoPAn

nfcapd		Multicast enabled:
			Add -j <join group>. Joins the specified multicast group ( v4 or v6 )
			for listening.

nfcapd		IPv6 enabled:
			Add option -4 and -6 for IPv4 and IPv6. By default, listen on IPv4.
			Option -b <host/IP> to bind for a specific host/IP address automatically
			selects appropriate protocol.

nfnet.c		All functions to setup network sockets for listening/sending are 
			put into this file.
